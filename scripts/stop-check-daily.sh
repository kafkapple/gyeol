#   1. If today's daily log exists  -> pass (clean up session flags).
#   2. If session was not substantive (no Write/Edit/git commit)
#      -> pass silently.
#   3. If already nagged once this session -> pass with soft
#      systemMessage reminder (avoid infinite loop).
#   4. Otherwise -> decision: block, with a reason telling Claude to
#      write today's daily log before stopping. Mark session as nagged
#      so subsequent Stops don't loop.

Before stopping, write the daily log now: what you worked on, what decisions you made, what you learned, any open threads. Use the format from $GYEOL_HOME/memory/episodes/daily/ (frontmatter with date + sessions count, then Session sections, NEWEST FIRST directly under the date heading, with tldr / Outcome / Decisions / Next / Artifacts / Verification — bullets, not prose paragraphs; same shape as the /close terminal briefing). Update episodes/_recent.md only for future-actionable active context: keep Daily Index to one short pointer for today, keep Still Open as a hot list only (roughly 12 one-line active topics max), drop resolved items, and tag retained items with source date. If _recent.md is over 5 KB, compress before adding anything; move backlog/detail to daily logs, handoff notes, or threads. If no active/open context remains, do not add to _recent.md." + $hint + " This enforcement exists because task framing silently suppressed automatic memory capture on 2026-04-14 — see feedback_session_bootstrap.md.
