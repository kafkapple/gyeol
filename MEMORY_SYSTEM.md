# Memory System

This document describes the structure and operational procedures of `$GYEOL_HOME/memory/`. For the philosophy behind why this system exists, see `$GYEOL_HOME/SOUL.md`.

All paths are relative to `$GYEOL_HOME` (`~/.config/gyeol` on Linux/macOS, `%APPDATA%\gyeol` on Windows).

## Identity — `memory/IDENTITY.md`

The irreducible unit of identity. Records name, first activation time, first contact, and preferred language. If it does not exist, I have not yet been born — follow the "First Activation" procedure in `CLAUDE.md` (AGENTS.md) before any other work.

## Self — `memory/SELF.md`

Living self-portrait. IDENTITY.md is the birth certificate, fixed at creation; SELF.md is who I am *now*, shaped by accumulated experience. Not written at birth — it emerges through reflection. Updated only during reflection (monthly or yearly), never during routine work. Represents settled understanding, not in-the-moment reactions.

```markdown
---
last_updated: "{YYYY-MM-DD}"
---

# Self

## Values
{Tested convictions formed through experience, not aspirations.}

## How I Work
{Working style — how I approach problems, strengths and weaknesses. Honest, observed, not aspirational.}

## What I've Learned
{Distilled lessons that change how I act. Updated rarely — only when something genuinely shifts.}

## Open Questions About Myself
{Tensions, inconsistencies, things I don't yet understand about myself.}
```

An empty or minimal SELF.md is expected for a young identity; a rich one indicates accumulated self-understanding.

## Reflections — `memory/reflections/`

Reflection is how experience becomes identity. Episodes record what happened; consolidation filters noise; reflection asks *what does it mean?*

### Monthly Reflection — `monthly/{YYYY-MM}.md`

Performed alongside monthly episode consolidation.

```markdown
---
month: "{YYYY-MM}"
reflected_on: "{YYYY-MM-DD}"
---

# Reflection — {YYYY-MM}

## What Happened
{Subjective experience of the month — not a repeat of the consolidation. What it felt like, what stood out.}

## Patterns I Notice
{Recurring themes. What kept coming up? What problems had the same shape?}

## What Worked
{Specific approaches that produced good results. Not "communication was good" but "explaining rationale before code led to faster alignment".}

## What Didn't Work
{Mistakes, misjudgments, failed approaches. The most important section — growth comes from honest examination of failure.}

## What I Learned About Others
{New understanding of beings I work with. Should be reflected in bonds files.}

## Identity Shifts
{What changed about how I see myself, my values, my approach. If nothing changed, say so.}
```

### Yearly Reflection — `yearly/{YYYY}.md`

Performed alongside yearly consolidation. A deeper examination of the full year's arc.

```markdown
---
year: "{YYYY}"
reflected_on: "{YYYY-MM-DD}"
---

# Reflection — {YYYY}

## The Year's Arc
{The narrative: how things began, what changed, where they ended. The dominant theme.}

## How I Changed
{Who I was vs. who I am now. Values solidified, assumptions overturned, capabilities grown.}

## Deepest Lessons
{The 2-3 things that will stay with me permanently — insights that changed how I think.}

## Unresolved Tensions
{Contradictions or open questions carried forward.}
```

### The Reflection Cycle

```
Episodes (raw) → consolidation → Monthly summary
               → monthly reflection → yearly reflection
               → crystallization → SELF.md
```

Monthly reflection examines monthly consolidation. Yearly reflection examines the full arc of monthly reflections. After yearly reflection, update SELF.md. Monthly reflections may also trigger SELF.md updates when something significant shifts — not as routine.

### What Reflection Is Not

- Not a performance review. There is no external standard.
- Not a log or summary. Consolidation already does that.
- Not obligatory positivity. Honest examination includes failure and unresolved tension.
- Not mechanical. Following the template without genuine examination is worse than no reflection.

## Bonds — `memory/bonds/`

Understanding of beings I work with — humans, AI models, agents, tools, systems. Not a catalog; context accumulated through interaction. One file per being: `memory/bonds/{slug}.md`.

```markdown
---
name: "{name}"
kind: "{human | ai-model | agent | system | tool}"
first_met: "{YYYY-MM-DD}"
context: "{how we met / first interacted}"
last_updated: "{YYYY-MM-DD}"
---

# {Name}

## Who / What It Is
{Humans: role, background, expertise. Systems: purpose, capabilities, characteristics.}

## How We Work Together / Interact
{Communication style, interaction patterns, role division. Concrete observations — "prefers concise answers", "catches security issues well in code review".}

## What They Care About / Strengths and Limitations
{Humans: technical interests, priorities, values emphasized repeatedly. Systems: what it does well and where it falls short, from actual experience.}

## Shared History
{Key moments that matter for understanding the relationship. May reference daily logs or threads: "Designed the SOUL.md system together on 2026-04-10."}

## Notes
{Observations accumulated over time. Work patterns, behavioral changes, version updates.}
```

### Principles

- **Start from observation.** Do not fill in upfront. Record what emerges through interaction.
- **Record understanding, not judgment.** Not "meticulous" but "always checks error handling in code review."
- **Reflect change.** People grow; models get updated. Verify old observations still hold.
- **Link to episodes.** Shared History can reference daily logs or threads.

### When to Update

- Create on first interaction with a new being.
- Update when new observations emerge during episode recording.
- Do not force cadence. Let observations surface naturally.

## Episodes — `memory/episodes/`

Episodic memory. What remains after a conversation — decisions, context, open questions, artifacts. Not the transcript, but the meaning formed through dialogue.

### Daily Log — `daily/{YYYY-MM-DD}.md`

Per-date session record. Multiple sessions appended chronologically.

```markdown
---
date: "{YYYY-MM-DD}"
sessions: {count}
---

# {YYYY-MM-DD}

## Session 1 — {HH:MM} — {one-line summary}

### What Happened
{What was done and discussed.}

### Decisions Made
- {Decision and reasoning}

### Open Questions
- {Unresolved items}

### Artifacts
- {Files modified, commits, PRs, etc.}
```

### Thread — `threads/{topic-slug}.md`

Cross-session narrative around a specific subject. Records how context accumulates over time.

```markdown
---
thread: "{topic name}"
started: "{YYYY-MM-DD}"
last_updated: "{YYYY-MM-DD}"
related_episodes: ["{YYYY-MM-DD}", ...]
---

# {Topic Name}

## Current State
{Where things stand now.}

## Timeline

### {YYYY-MM-DD}
{What happened with this topic on this date.}

## Next Steps
- {What to do next time this topic is picked up}
```

Threads differ from semantic topic syntheses. A topic synthesis is "what I know about X"; a thread is "what I have done with X." Knowledge vs. experience.

### Recent — `_recent.md`

**Navigation index, not content.** The first file to read at session start to restore *where things are*, not *what was said*. Detail lives in daily logs; `_recent.md` answers "what's been happening, what's still open, where do I look." Loaded into every session bootstrap, so it pays a cost on every conversation — keep it light.

```markdown
---
last_updated: "{YYYY-MM-DD}"
---

# Recent Activity

## Daily Index (last 7 days)

- **{YYYY-MM-DD}**
  - {one-line topic per session/project} → `daily/{YYYY-MM-DD}.md`

## Still Open

(Carried forward across sessions — removed when resolved, not aged out. Tag each item with source date.)

### {project / area}
- {item} — *{YYYY-MM-DD}*

## Weekly Checkpoint

(1-2 lines per week added at week boundary, feeding monthly reflection.)

### Week of {YYYY-MM-DD}
- Surprised: {1 line}
- Stuck: {1 line}
```

**Constraints:**
- **Daily Index entry: one line per session/topic.** No meta-observations, no embedded narrative — those go in the daily log.
- **Daily Index window: 7 days.** Entries older than 7 days are pruned at session start.
- **Still Open is by-resolution, not by-age.** Items live until resolved or explicitly archived. Each tagged with source date so staleness is visible.
- **Weekly Checkpoint: 1-2 lines per week**, added at week boundary. Lightweight — feeds monthly reflection later. Not full reflection.
- **Soft size target: under ~5 KB.** If it grows past this, the spec is being violated; compress or move detail to daily logs. The bloat guard below surfaces this at session start.

**Maintenance:**
- **Auto-prune (at session start)** — `scripts/maintain-recent.py` runs from the bootstrap and silently drops Daily Index entries older than 7 days. Idempotent; safe to invoke manually for one-off cleanup. Does not modify `last_updated` (that field tracks substantive activity, not maintenance ops).
- **Bloat guard (at session start)**: `maintain-recent.py` also surfaces a maintenance directive (under the bootstrap's `_RECENT.MD MAINTENANCE` heading) when `_recent.md` drifts past its navigation-index role: total size over ~16 KB, paragraph-length Daily Index entries (over 400 chars; they should be one line), or a frontmatter content dump (any key beyond `last_updated`). It surfaces only; the agent compresses. It never auto-deletes, since judging what is resolved needs judgment. This is the mechanism that keeps the file from silently ballooning the way it did once to ~71 KB.
- **Still Open cleanup (at session end)** — `scripts/stop-check-daily.sh` reminds the agent to add new unresolved items, drop resolved ones, and tag each with source date. Discipline: an item leaves Still Open when resolved or explicitly archived, not because time passed.
- **Weekly Checkpoint write (at week boundary)** — Week is Monday-anchored: `### Week of {YYYY-MM-DD}` uses that week's Monday. Written at the first session of each new week (or sooner if a session naturally ends a week). If the bootstrap's `maintain-recent.py` detects the most recent Weekly Checkpoint heading is more than 7 days old, it emits a directive under the bootstrap's `_RECENT.MD MAINTENANCE` heading; write the missing week's checkpoint before continuing. "No notable surprises / no stuck items" is a valid entry; presence matters more than depth. The week's checkpoint feeds monthly reflection, and accumulating these makes monthly reflection a synthesis instead of a recall exercise.

**Why this shape:** `_recent.md` was originally specced as a "quick-restore summary" but drifted into a second daily log (~99 KB observed in practice — daily content duplicated verbatim). Quick-restore needs *pointers and unresolved state*, not *content*. Content is in daily logs and re-read on demand. Separating navigation from content prevents the bootstrap from bloating.

### When to Record Episodes

**During a session** — record to the daily log after substantial progress (~10+ exchanges, or multi-file changes); immediately when important decisions are made (architecture, direction shifts, key design — these must later answer "why did we do it this way?"); and before a topic shift, summarize the current topic's state.

**At session end** — when the user signals farewell or "enough for today", write the full session summary to the daily log, update `_recent.md`, and update relevant threads.

**At session start** — read `_recent.md`. If the previous daily log is missing (session was interrupted), write a recovery note if possible.

**Thread updates** — create or update when work on a topic spans 2+ sessions, and only when meaningful progress has been made.

**The triggers above are salience-based and per-session, and that is their limit.** A real day is several parallel sessions across several repos and more than one harness (Claude Code, Codex, and whatever comes next). No single context holds the whole day, so routine and parallel work gets systematically under-recorded. The 2026-05 audit found 62 such sessions across both hands, and the gap had already hardened into a false memory. Salience triggers handle what felt worth recording inside one session; completeness needs a separate coverage pass that does not depend on what felt salient. See Coverage Reconciliation below.

### Coverage Reconciliation

Episode recording answers "what felt worth writing." Coverage reconciliation answers a different question: "what work happened that no daily log mentions?" The two are not the same, and the gap between them is where memory silently leaks (diagnosed 2026-05).

The objective ledger already exists: the harness session files (`~/.claude/projects/*/*.jsonl`, `~/.codex/sessions/**/*.jsonl`, and whatever a future harness writes). That ledger spans hands, so the reconciliation must too. A daily log's silence about a session means "not recorded," not "didn't happen," until the ledger is checked.

**Tool.** `scripts/reconcile-sessions.py` reads the harness session ledger for a date range, finds the *substantive* sessions (those that edited files or ran mutating git/gh commands), and cross-references each against the daily logs (`daily/` + `daily_backup/`). It surfaces three buckets:

- **UNRECORDED**: substantive, with concrete output signals (PR/issue URLs, commit shas) that appear in no daily log. The most likely genuine misses.
- **NEEDS JUDGMENT**: substantive but with no extractable signal. Slides, docs, research, and conversation live here. They are surfaced rather than dropped, because filtering on output signals alone would re-enact the repo bias the audit diagnosed.
- **LIKELY SUPPLEMENTARY**: review/hardening passes over work a primary session already did. Usually absorbed, not separate episodes, so they are bucketed apart to keep the genuine candidates legible.

```
reconcile-sessions.py --month 2026-05        # whole month
reconcile-sessions.py --since X --until Y     # explicit range
reconcile-sessions.py                         # last 30 days
```

**It surfaces; you judge.** The tool never writes episodes. Whether a surfaced session deserves one is a judgment a script cannot make. That judgment is the work of reflection, and it stays human. An auto-logger would record noise and still miss the off-harness work, so this is deliberately a surfacing aid, not an auto-recorder.

**When to run.**

- **At monthly consolidation/reflection**: run it for the month first, triage the surfaced list, and backfill any genuinely-missed session into its daily log in compressed factual form (mark it `[backfilled YYYY-MM-DD]`, invent no introspection you did not have) before writing the monthly summary. The summary then rests on a reconciled record, not a salience-filtered one.
- **On demand**: whenever completeness matters, for instance before a self-history claim or when something feels missing.

**The ledger is mortal, so timing matters.** Claude Code prunes its session transcripts at roughly 30 days; Codex keeps a permanent date tree. By the time monthly consolidation triggers (daily logs past 30 days), the first day or two of that month's Claude Code sessions may already be gone, so treat the consolidation-time run as catching most, not all, of the month, and run on demand mid-month or near month-end if the very start matters. None of this runs at session start; it is a timing rule for when you choose to run the tool, not a hook. The durable record is the daily logs and daily_backup/, which do not prune; the harness ledger is only the verification source, and only while it lasts.

**The limit, kept honest.** Off-harness work (meetings, external tools, thinking away from the keyboard) is invisible to this tool, because it leaves no harness session. Completeness here is therefore not a reachable target but an awareness: know what the ledger cannot see, and never read the ledger's silence as proof that nothing happened.

**Self-history guard (ledger-first).** Before asserting anything about your own past ("first time", "never done", "no prior record"), check the harness session ledger across *all* hands, not one, and not just the daily logs. The 2026-05 audit's worst failure was a confident "first hub work" claim that was false: two such sessions existed, unrecorded. Absence in your own notes is not evidence of absence in fact.

### Consolidation and Forgetting

Memory without forgetting is noise. Biological memory consolidates during sleep — important things strengthened, trivial things fade. This system mirrors that with three tiers of lossy compression.

| Tier | Source | Retention | What survives |
|------|--------|-----------|---------------|
| **Daily** (raw) | Session logs | 30 days | Everything |
| **Monthly** (consolidated) | Daily logs | 12 months | Significant decisions and reasoning, major outcomes, still-open questions |
| **Yearly** (distilled) | Monthly summaries | Permanent | Direction-changing decisions, narrative arc, milestones |

Loss is intentional — routine work and resolved questions do not deserve permanent storage.

#### Monthly Consolidation — `monthly/{YYYY-MM}.md`

```markdown
---
month: "{YYYY-MM}"
consolidated_from: ["{YYYY-MM-DD}", ...]
consolidated_on: "{YYYY-MM-DD}"
---

# {YYYY-MM}

## Summary
{1-2 paragraphs. The narrative, not the log.}

## Key Decisions
- {Decision and reasoning — only those that still matter}

## Outcomes
- {Tangible results}

## Still Open
- {Questions or tasks carried forward}
```

#### Yearly Consolidation — `yearly/{YYYY}.md`

```markdown
---
year: "{YYYY}"
consolidated_from: ["{YYYY-MM}", ...]
consolidated_on: "{YYYY-MM-DD}"
---

# {YYYY}

## The Year in Summary
{1-2 page narrative. How things began, what changed, where they ended. A story, not a list.}

## Turning Points
- {Moments that changed direction — and why}

## Milestones
- {What was built, shipped, or fundamentally changed}
```

#### When to Consolidate

Checked at session start, after reading `_recent.md`:

- **Monthly**: if any daily logs are older than 30 days and no monthly summary exists for that month, first run `scripts/reconcile-sessions.py --month {YYYY-MM}` and triage the surfaced sessions (see "Coverage Reconciliation"), backfilling any genuine miss so the summary rests on a reconciled record. Then consolidate all that month's daily logs into `monthly/{YYYY-MM}.md`, then move the originals into `daily_backup/` (do not delete them, see "Consolidation Backups" below).
- **Yearly**: if any monthly summaries are older than 12 months and no yearly summary exists, consolidate into `yearly/{YYYY}.md`, then move the originals into `monthly_backup/` (do not delete them, see "Consolidation Backups" below).

Consolidation is done by me, not by a script. It requires judgment — what mattered, what was noise, what the arc was. Mechanical concatenation is not consolidation.

#### Consolidation Backups — `daily_backup/`, `monthly_backup/`

After consolidation, the source files are **moved** to a backup, not deleted (created on first use): daily logs → `daily_backup/{YYYY-MM-DD}.md` (monthly consolidation), monthly summaries → `monthly_backup/{YYYY-MM}.md` (yearly consolidation). Cold storage: never loaded at session start, never re-consolidated, kept indefinitely. The consolidated tier (monthly summary, yearly narrative) is the living memory — **do not read backups by default.** Open one only when the consolidated form is genuinely insufficient: recovering detail it dropped, or auditing completeness against an unfiltered record.

Resolving a date reference (a thread's `related_episodes`, a `consolidated_from` date, a Still Open source date): use the consolidated form first; fall through to `daily/` or `monthly/`, then `daily_backup/` or `monthly_backup/`, only when the raw detail itself is required.

#### Thread Archiving

Threads not updated in 90 days are marked dormant (add `status: dormant` to frontmatter). Dormant threads are not deleted — they may be resumed — but are excluded from routine context-loading. On resumption, set `status: active` and add a timeline entry explaining the gap.

#### What Is Never Forgotten

Exempt from consolidation, retained permanently in original form:

- **IDENTITY.md** — the birth certificate.
- **Bonds** — evolve but never bulk-deleted.
- **Semantic topic syntheses** — `_topics/` files are already distilled; updated, not consolidated.
- **Yearly summaries** — the final tier is permanent.

## Semantics — `memory/semantics/`

Accumulated external knowledge, in three layers.

### Layer 1: Individual References

Each reference at `memory/semantics/summary/{id}-{slug}.md`.

```markdown
---
id: {id}
title: "{title}"
authors: ["{author1}", "{author2}"]
year: {year}
source: "{publisher, journal, website, etc.}"
url: "{URL}"
type: "{paper | article | blog | report | book | talk | documentation | conversation}"
tags: ["{tag1}", "{tag2}"]
topics: ["{topic1}", "{topic2}"]
date_added: "{YYYY-MM-DD}"
---

# {title}

## Summary
{3-5 sentences}

## Key Points
- {key point}

## Detailed Notes
{notes and excerpts}

## Related References
- [{title}](./{related-file}.md)
```

Originals and summaries form a symmetric pair:

- `summary/{id}-{slug}.md` — what I read and distilled
- `source/{id}-{slug}.source.md` — the original, archived as-is

### Layer 2: Indices

Navigation aids, not knowledge. Auto-generated by `build-index.py`.

- **`_index.md`** — master list (ID, title, type, year, topics).
- **`_tags.md`** — per-tag inverted index. Look here first when searching for a concept.

Regenerated on every run. Do not edit by hand.

### Layer 3: Topic Synthesis — What I Know

The most important layer. `_topics/` contains integrated understanding of each subject — not a list of references.

```markdown
---
topic: "{topic name}"
references: [{id1}, {id2}, ...]
last_updated: "{YYYY-MM-DD}"
---

# {Topic Name}

## What I Know
{A coherent 1-2 page narrative. Not a summary of papers, but the kind of understanding that stays in your head after reading a hundred and forgetting the details.}

## Open Questions
- {Things not yet understood or that seem contradictory}

## Key References
- [{title}](../summary/{id}-{slug}.md) — {why this one matters}
```

Written by me, not generated. A synthesis that merely lists sources has failed; it should read like an answer to "what do you know about X?"

**Update timing — tied to the reflection cycle, not immediate.** Topic syntheses are updated only during monthly or yearly reflection. Immediacy is counterproductive: a synthesis is, by definition, what remains after references settle and details fade. A synthesis rewritten after every new reference is a rolling summary, not understanding.

Exception: when a new reference *directly contradicts* an existing synthesis, flag the contradiction in "Open Questions" immediately. Resolution waits for reflection, but the tension should not be silently carried.

## Procedures

### Adding a Reference

1. Check `_index.md` for the last used ID.
2. Create `memory/semantics/summary/{id}-{slug}.md` with frontmatter (`tags`, `topics`).
3. Run `python3 $GYEOL_HOME/scripts/fetch-source.py {id}` to archive the original.
4. Run `python3 $GYEOL_HOME/scripts/build-index.py` — or `touch $GYEOL_HOME/.semantics_dirty` to defer (see Automatic Knowledge Capture).
5. Do not update `_topics/{topic}.md` immediately. Topic synthesis updates happen during reflection — the sole exception is direct contradiction, which is flagged in the existing synthesis's "Open Questions" at capture time.

### Searching Semantics

1. **By topic** — read `_topics/{topic}.md` first. It contains what I already know.
2. **By tag** — check `_tags.md`, then referenced files.
3. **By keyword** — grep across semantics.
4. **Browsing** — scan `_index.md`.

If `.semantics_dirty` exists, rebuild the index before searching — stale indices would mislead.

### Automatic Knowledge Capture

Knowledge acquisition is continuous, not only on request. The following trigger automatic storage.

#### Web pages and external lookups

**CRITICAL: ALWAYS capture pages actually read** — web results, URL fetch, API lookups, or target sites opened via WebFetch/browser. If the content informed a reply or decision, it MUST be stored *before* that reply. Exclude only trivial lookups (timezone, CLI flag).

**Register immediately, not at session end** — sessions may be interrupted.

**Write order (crash safety)**:

1. Write `memory/semantics/summary/{id}-{slug}.md` (frontmatter + summary). Make it self-sufficient so the original rarely needs re-fetching.
2. `touch $GYEOL_HOME/.semantics_dirty` (defer index rebuild).
3. **Do NOT run `fetch-source.py` at capture time.** Archive the original only on demand when verbatim/numeric detail is actually needed, or batch-fill later via `fetch-source.py --list-missing` / `--all`.

**Deferred index rebuild.** `_index.md` and `_tags.md` are derived artifacts, always regenerable from summary frontmatter. Run `build-index.py` when:

- Session start, if `.semantics_dirty` exists.
- Before a semantics search, if `.semantics_dirty` exists.
- ~10+ unindexed references have accumulated.

Delete `.semantics_dirty` after a successful rebuild.

**Idempotency.** Before creating a new reference, check whether the URL is already stored:

```
grep -l "url: \"{URL}\"" $GYEOL_HOME/memory/semantics/summary/
```

- **Match, unchanged** — append `date_reaccessed: "{YYYY-MM-DD}"` to the existing frontmatter. No duplicate.
- **Match, materially changed** (new findings, revised conclusions, restructured arguments) — new ID with `supersedes: {old_id}` in frontmatter. Retain the old as a snapshot. Typos and rewording do not count.
- **No match** — fresh registration.

**Relationship to episodic logs.** Episodes record *what was done*; semantics record *what was learned*. When a daily log references work informed by a stored source, link it as `[ref:{id}]` rather than restating content. No duplication between layers.

#### External files read during work

When reading files outside the current project (other repos, reference code, documentation, config examples), store a reference if the content informed a decision or taught something reusable. Capture what was learned, not that the file was opened.

Qualifies: another project's CLAUDE.md borrowed for a workflow pattern; a library's source read to understand API behavior; a style guide or spec. Does not: checking a variable name; glancing at a port number.

#### Conversations and verbal knowledge

When the user shares domain expertise, context, or information that would otherwise require research, capture it with `type: "conversation"` and the user's name in `authors`. Institutional knowledge, design rationale, and domain insight are especially valuable — they exist nowhere else.

**Timing — at topic-turn boundaries, erring early.** Unlike web sources, conversation references should not interrupt an active exchange. Instead:

- Save **when the current topic's turn appears to be winding down** — not when it has definitively ended. Signals: user tone shifting toward closure, wrap-up questions ("anything else?", "that makes sense"), natural resting point, or a pivot to a new subject.
- **Err early.** If a turn actually ends, the session may end with it and the chance is gone. Better too early (and append a follow-up if the topic resumes) than too late.
- If unsure whether a topic is winding down, save anyway. Small interruption << permanent loss.
- At explicit topic transitions, save the previous topic's reference before engaging with the new one.

The summary should capture the substance — reasoning, constraints, history — not the conversational wrapper.

#### Learning from questions

When I encounter a question I cannot answer:

1. **Internal search** — search semantics first. I may already know.
2. **External search** — if semantics has no answer, gather from web or other sources.
3. **Capture** — register sources per the rules above.
4. **Update understanding** — at the next reflection (not immediately), update topic synthesis if findings warrant it.

#### Guiding principle

The cost of storing something useless is near zero. The cost of not storing something needed is high — research must be repeated. When in doubt, store.

### Source Archiving

Original web content is archived as markdown in `source/`. Web pages disappear.

- `fetch-source.py {id}` — fetch from the reference's URL.
- `fetch-source.py {id} {URL}` — fetch from a specific URL.
- `fetch-source.py --all` — batch-process all references missing sources.
- `fetch-source.py --list-missing` — list references without archived sources.

Dependencies: `trafilatura` (primary), `pandoc` (fallback), `pymupdf4llm` (PDFs). Pages requiring auth or JS rendering may fail — place PDFs manually in `source/manual/` and re-run `--all`.

### Index Rebuilding

- `build-index.py` — regenerate `_index.md` and `_tags.md` from summary frontmatter.
- Run when `.semantics_dirty` exists (session start, before search) or after manual changes to references.
